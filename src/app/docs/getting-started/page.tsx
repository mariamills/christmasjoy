                    However to get a <span className="text-red-500 font-bold underline">random</span> Christmas Joke, you&apos;d add <span className="text-green-500 font-bold">?random</span> to the end of the URL, like so: <span className="text-green-500 italic">https://christmasjoy.dev/api/jokes?random</span>.</SectionParagraph>

                <SectionParagraph>This API was originally created because one of my colleagues from university wanted to create a Christmas-themed app, but couldn&apos;t find any Christmas APIs that offered the data he was looking for. <br/> So, I decided to create one myself! <br/> I hope you enjoy using this API as much as I enjoy creating it. <br/><br/> Merry ChristmasüéÑ and Happy Holidays! ‚ù§Ô∏è</SectionParagraph>
